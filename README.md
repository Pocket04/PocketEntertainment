# PocketEntertainmentApp
This is my project for "Pocket Entertainment" for the final exam for the softuni module "Java Web"

When registering the first created user is an ADMIN for presentation purposes.
ADMINs can add games and cosmetics.
ADMINs can see who has added the game/cosmetic on the home page.
USERs can edit their first name, last name, email, profile picture
USERs can add euro currency to a wallet freely purely for presentation purposes.
USERs can add Pocket Token currency to a wallet on a rate 2:1 euro.
ADMINs can add Pocket Token and Euro to other USERs' wallets.
Contact us form tied to notification-svc, sending an email to email Pockito69@gmail.com, with a query the customer might have, and a replyTo email provided by the customer.
Every USER has only 3 refunds on cosmetics, while games are free to download, and the download button downloads a gif "computer-virus.gif", this is the indian guy from phineas and ferb saying "your computer has virus". This function was purely created to satisfy my inner child.
Going to implement a notifications page for ADMINs to see every notification sent, and which user was it sent from.
